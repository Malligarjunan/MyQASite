I18nActionMailer
================

This plugin will allow ActionMailer to use the I18n library without affecting the controllers language.

Rails currently saves the locale in a thread. When you want to send an email in a different language, this value is used.
When the ActionMailer changes the locale, the controller will be affected. 

This library lets 
* the ActionMailer save it's own locale
* provide translation and localisation functions for the mailer
* override the ActionView translation methods to use the ActionMailer's locale

Example
=======

  class Mailer < ActionMailer::Base
  
    def greet_user(user)
      set_locale  user.locale
      subject     t('mailer.greet_user.title')
      recipients  user.email
      body        :user => user
    end
  
  end
